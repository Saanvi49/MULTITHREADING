# MULTITHREADING


This assignment showcases matrix multiplication through multithreading in Python, aiming to multiply 100 random matrices of size 1000x1000 with a constant matrix of the same size.

Multithreading enables concurrent task execution within a process, where threads share memory space and run independently. This setup optimizes CPU usage by leveraging multiple cores for parallel computation, improving performance.
